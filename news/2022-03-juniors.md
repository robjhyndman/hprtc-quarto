ðŸŽ¾  Greetings Tennis Families. ðŸŽ¾ 

We are fast approaching the end of the 21/22 Summer Season! 

Congrats to a number of our teams who have made finals, and well done to all teams for putting in a great season under tricky circumstances juggling COVID parameters. (You'll be able to tell your grandchildren in years to come about Covid Washouts!!) 

## WINTER 2022 SEASON

It is also time for us to get organised for the 2022 Winter Season. 

Please respond to this link so we can get our teams organised. 
https://forms.gle/ea5biv7hsY5c7anG9 

We need to enter teams with ERT by the end of this month so we need feedback from you all by FRIDAY MARCH 25. If you could click on the link asap that would be great. Go on- it will only take a couple of minutes!! 

## CLUB MEMBERSHIP 

A reminder that club membership is required to be part of a team. That is a non-negotiable, as it is for all team sports. You can't be in a team if you don't join the club!! It's essential for insurance purposes and is an association and club requirement. This side of things has taken up far too much time for myself and Chris, our lovely Club Membership Registrar. Your help is addressing this will hugely appreciated. 

**All players will need to be up to date with club membership BEFORE they are placed in a team- form AND payment. **

Chris is extremely helpful and will support you with all you need to do to have this on track. If you're not sure of your membership status, feel free to get in touch with her to check. (chriswish17@gmail.com , 0401 722 040) Please also note that membership runs on a financial year basis. All players will need to ensure that they keep their membership status current when we get to June/July. Chris is very happy to navigate this with you to cover Juniors seasons. 

Membership form is available from the club website at https://hprtc.org.au/members/. It's a great deal really. Not many sports have membership that enables you to have such great access to club facilities at other times during every week of the year!

## JUNIORS GET TOGETHER- COMING SOON  ðŸ¤ž

We're very conscious that we've not met together socially as Juniors for some time. COVID has had a big impact on social connections for quite a couple of years now and there are still some limitations around serving food. (What's a get together without food!!) We're hoping restrictions keep easing and we can get together as a big club bunch soon. Keep an eye out for details. 

Gosh- that's a lot of news on one hit! 

**Please get your form completed for Winter Comp asap.**

**Good luck for the finals to all our teams.**

**Well done to ALL of our juniors and their families** on navigating the great post-Covid lockdown summer season. It's been great to see you all back on the court.

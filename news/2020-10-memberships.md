The Committee would like to confirm that a 50% discount is on offer for renewal of membership for 2020/2021. If you haven't as yet renewed your membership, we hope this incentive will encourage you to do so -- here is the [membership form](http://hprtc.org.au/members/).

For those members who have renewed their membership already, we cannot provide a refund to you, but will give the 50% discount off of your 2021/2022 membership (next year).

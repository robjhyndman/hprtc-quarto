We are delighted that our courts finally have some lovely new nets, thanks to a grant from Bendigo Bank.

Dorothy Janky and one of her staff from Bendigo Bank visited the club yesterday to see the new nets, and to tour our facilities. Thanks to Mal McDonald for organizing the new nets, and for showing Dorothy around.

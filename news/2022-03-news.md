## President's Report

A warm welcome to all at Parker Reserve TC. A particular welcome to all
new members.

It is great to be back to competition tennis after such a long break. With
the return to competition comes responsibilities to the Club. Remember
to bag courts after play and to leave the club house tidy. Your committee
works hard to provide a great facility for you so please ensure you play
your part in keeping it great.

Good luck to all playing in competition, remember, it is a fun game and
just enjoy, win or lose.

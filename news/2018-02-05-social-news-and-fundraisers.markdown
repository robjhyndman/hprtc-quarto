Thanks to all members who supported four social and fundraising activities towards the end of 2017.

Viv White led a very successful sales drive for the Entertainment Book. $476 was raised, an amazing effort. Thank you Viv!

The Bunnings BBQ held in November raised $567.25 even though it was an extremely hot day. Thanks to all volunteers on the day.

The famous Christmas hamper was won by Margaret Lawler. We raised $761.55 and all hamper contents were donations. Thanks to Michael Sukkar for his donation of a large chocolate hamper! A huge thank you to all our generous sponsors from all branches for making this hamper so amazing.

Elizabeth Sloan (Social Secretary)

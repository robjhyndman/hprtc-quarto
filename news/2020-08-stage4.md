The Victorian Government announced that from 6pm on Sunday 2 August, Victoria entered a State of Disaster.

Consequently, all tennis clubs and facilities must close in Metropolitan Melbourne until further notice.

We know this is a difficult time for everyone. It is important that we respect the new restrictions for our own health and the health and safety of the wider community.

Please do stay safe and healthy during this difficult time and hopefully we can see a return to tennis again in the Spring.

Kind regards

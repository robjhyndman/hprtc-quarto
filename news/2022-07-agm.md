## Memberships

[Memberships](https://hprtc.org.au/members/) are now overdue. Please make sure you are financial and forward a copy back to the club especially if any of your details have changed.

The club needs additional parents / players / members to help out with the general running of the club too. So have a look and see if you feel you're in a position to help out with any of the vacant roles or indeed any role that you may be interested in. Committee will be more than happy to help mold a role to your availability in most instances.

Of course, reach out to me if you have any questions, and hope to see you on the 13th August.

Club Secretary<br>

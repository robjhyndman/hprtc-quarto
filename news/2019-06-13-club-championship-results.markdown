What a weekend!!

With a far from ideal weather forecast, all matches were completed with lots of new & old faces which saw the weekend played in good spirit with lots of laughs and great companionship from all.

Highlights from the weekend included the once again wonderful selection of food on offering - sausage rolls & scones that remind you of the good old days. They don't come much better!

The competition on court was hard & fast with some new faces and hard fought battles.

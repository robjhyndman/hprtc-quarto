We're so excited to say we're able to open up a little further.

As per directions from the State Government and Tennis Victoria, tennis as a community sport can return for the minimum number required. That means players and/or coaches only, no spectators and no competition just yet. This will mean community social tennis can return but please remember we still need to socially distance with masks if not on court and please always check in with the QR codes whenever at the club. The club room is still closed at the moment.

There has been no change to the coaching directions, or competition at this point.

Stay safe, and happy hitting.

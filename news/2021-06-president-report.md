Dear members

Another financial year is ending, and our AGM is fast approaching. It has been very rewarding to see that people have persisted with their tennis commitments through the many interruptions of our regular scheduled routines both competitions, coaching and social play. We have certainly become very flexible in adjusting our calendars at the drop of a hat!

The main purpose of this note is to request some commitment at renewal time to fill in the [entire Membership form](/members/) and sign the [Code of Conduct form](/about/conduct/) (which we sent out with the AGM notification), as we strive to update our records.

As it is important to us that your privacy is protected, these forms are kept in house for the HE Parker tennis Club records.

We have always taken pride in the fact that our club provides a friendly safe inclusive environment for the whole community. All our coaches and committee members are required to have a WWC check. It would be appreciated if you could indicate if you have a WWC check too.

My final request is to ask you to consider stepping into a role on the committee this year. I have spent more than 15 years on the committee in variousroles and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. It is a great group of people to work and play with and we need YOU to join us to continue to grow. Every pair of hands ensures that the load is shared

Please note that during school holidays there is social tennis on Wednesday nights, play starts at 7pm sharp ! See you there.

Warmest wishes & Happy hitting!

Sue Moreland

Frank and Betty Secomb were the first Life Members of our
great club. While Betty died some years ago, Frank celebrated his 102nd birthday on 20 August 2020.

During the mid to late 1970s, we did not have enough courts for all juniors to play Saturday morning competition, so courts in the area needed to be hired. Frank and Betty had a court at the rear of their home on the corner of Heathmont Road and Bennett Ave – you have probably passed it many times without realising it. They kindly made their court available to the club for competition.

For those who remember Frank, he was always impeccably dressed and was a
“complete gentleman”.

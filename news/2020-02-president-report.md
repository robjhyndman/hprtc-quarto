Welcome to the 2020 season of tennis!

It promises to be a busy time for all players with each associations’ season into the third week already. The heavy rain last week made us bless our courts as yet again we managed to get through matches where other clubs were forced to wash out. We even played social tennis on Saturday afternoon during the drizzle and the courts held up well. The dry weather over Christmas followed by the heavy rain has washed quite a lot of debris onto the property so we have planned a working Bee for Saturday the 14th March to tidy up the grounds. A list of jobs to be attempted is on the notice board in the club house. We are not limited to just these if you have any ideas of your own on what needs doing. Please join us any time after 11 am on Saturday and give us a hand. A pair of gardening gloves is advisable if you wish to work outside. A BBQ will be on the go for all participants.

We have received the new nets which were procured due to the generous grant sponsorship from the Ringwood East and Heathmont Bendigo Bank branches. The new manager of Heathmont branch, Dorothy Janky, visited recently to see the results of their grant. They are already on courts 4 and 5 with the others to follow soon. Many thanks Bendigo Bank.

The JUNIOR season finishes end of term 1 with the new teams for Winter season to be organised as soon as possible. This is an enormous task for our wonderful Junior convenor James Wotherspoon, and you can certainly help by clearly letting him know your child’s availability as soon as possible.

Uniforms can be ordered for those who need them, both senior and junior, by contacting Erina Wotherspoon on 0409868789. We have a limited amount of stock on hand and orders can take around 4 weeks to arrive so allow some time for delivery.

The Inter club round robin held on the 18th and 19 January was great fun. In the end Parker reserve put in two teams and we were joined by Heathmont and Miller Park. There was a terrific atmosphere with all players enjoying the format which saw a total of 12 sets being played by each participant over the two days. The Overall winner was Heathmont
who played outstanding tennis. We made some new friends and look forward to repeating
the event in the future.

Keep your eyes open for the Club Championship dates which will likely be held in April. We would love to have as many members as possible take part this year. It will appear on the website, [hprtc.org.au](http://hprtc.org.au) which has had a recent makeover.

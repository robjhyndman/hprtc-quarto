Under the latest restrictions, tennis can be played at our Parker Reserve Courts, but please comply with the following rules issued by Tennis Victoria.

1. Social distancing of 1.5 meters to be applied at all times.
2. Doubles and singles may be played.
3. No more than 10 participants in a group. When there is a coaching group with 10 people on a court, please leave a court spare on either side.
4. One supervisory adult is allowed on site per child.
5. Sanitiser is provided on court --- please sanitise regularly and assume all surfaces are contaminated.
6. Clubhouse is off-limits to everyone except coach and committee.
7. Please make use of the external toilet, and kindly clean after use.
8. Equipment can now be shared provided it is cleaned between users.

Strict adherence to physical distancing and hygiene protocols is required and expected at all times --- and we appreciate everyone's cooperation in this regard.

Happy hitting!

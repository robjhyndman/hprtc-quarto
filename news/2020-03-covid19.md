Dear Members,

As I am sure you are all aware the process of social distancing has invaded every aspect of our daily lives as the Government seeks to guide us in sterile techniques and quarantine procedures to prevent all possible contamination opportunities.

Therefore, as of 12 pm, Friday 27 March, there will be no access to the HE Parker tennis club Pavilion. Council will be disabling all access swipes to ensure the club house remains empty until further notice. Please note that this also means there are no toilet facilities that can be used on site.

Keep well and I hope the next message you get from us is the resumption of play, sooner rather than later.

Kind Regards,

Sue Moreland

(President)

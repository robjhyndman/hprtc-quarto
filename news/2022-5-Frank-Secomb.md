Today we farewelled Frank Secomb, our first life member with his wife
Betty.  Frank had settled in Heathmont after the second world war and
had a significant influence on the development of Heathmont such as
forming our tennis club (from Heathmont Methodist TC), the introduction
of the Heathmont Kindergarten/Hall in Viviani Cres, the development of a
general store on the corner of Canterbury Road and Heathmont Road - all
the start of Heathmont Village.  Next time you go past the corner of
Heathmont Rd and Bennett Ave, give Frank a wave.  His tennis court is
still there.

Frank died at the ripe old age of 103. A complete gentleman who was always impeccably dressed.

## President's Report

Welcome to a belated Newsletter. Many things have happened since the last newsletter and events are being planned for 2023. A long overdue Club Champs is pinned for Saturday and Sunday 18th and 19th November. Keep this day free as it will be an opportunity for some fun social play as well as the championship play matches. In
November when our gardens are calling for some attention, the plan is to have a plant sale to raise funds for the club. Keen gardeners please start making cuttings and getting plants ready if you’re able to help us here.

The Club has had discussions with Maroondah Council and our lease fee to the council has been increased. Together with other expense increases, we have had to increase our fees for the first time in some years. The fees have been updated on our website and are as follows:

* Family Year Membership $360
* Adult Year Membership $170
* Junior Year Membership $85

All other fees remain the same. Fees are due on a financial year basis so will be due July 1st 2023 for the following 12 months. Banking details are below, please use your last name (or child’s name if paying a Junior Membership) and Fees when making a payment so committee can allocate accordingly.

Many thanks to all who contribute to the running of the club, Sue.

## AGM – Saturday 29th July 2023

Your tennis club has been built up over many years, from 4 en-tout-cas courts and a log cabin clubhouse to the 6 poly clay waterless courts (complete with lighting) and a re-modelled clubhouse. Many of the current committee members have been working over many years in developing the club. As such, some committee members are looking at handing over, at least some of their responsibilities to the “next generation” of players/members. Now is the time to get involved while the “current generation” is able to transition new people into management positions. It is clearly understood that future management may look completely different to the current committee structure, but this change will need to be developed by you, the next managers.

***Please give earnest consideration to becoming involved in the club.*** Please let any of the current management committee, Ben or Kish, if you would like to be involved or would like more information.

## Night Competition Run Down

Night Tennis is going strong at HE Parker with us playing in two district competitions. Team Mark, Rob, Alexey, Lenelle, Chris and Mia play Wednesday nights in the Lilydale District competition and won the Summer Season last month. They are now embarking on their Winter campaign in Section 2.

In the Knox District Night Tennis Association (KDNTA) for the just finishing Summer Season. We had two teams playing on Monday night mixed. One in Section 2 and one in section 4. The Section 4 team made it through to the Grand Final which at time of print they are yet to play.

Tuesday night we had 2 Section 6 Open teams, one of which finished up 2nd but lost out in their Semi Final.

And Thursday night fielded a Section 4, 5 and 6 Singles Doubles teams. At time of print the Section 6 team made it as far as Preliminary Finals with Section 4 just missing out in their Semi Finals.

## Mid-Week Ladies Run Down

In conjunction with the Senior Championships, we will be hosting a HUGE Plant Sale, which will be in operation from 10am to 2pm on the Sunday. All proceeds go towards the ongoing operation of our beautiful club!

There’ll be heaps of outdoor plants available to purchase (cash only please), and our wonderful club volunteers will be there to answer any gardening questions you may have. Tell all your family and friends too - the sale is open to everyone!

We look forward to seeing you on the court soon!

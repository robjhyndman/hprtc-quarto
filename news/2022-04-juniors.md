## Summer 2021/22 wrap up 

Congratulations to our JOSD1 and JDC1 teams who were successful in [winning their grand final matches](https://hprtc.org.au/news/juniors-gf-apr22-04-2022/) last weekend. Well done to Hana, Nicholas, Matthew, Charlie, Harvey, Alynna, Raymond and Milo!! 

Congrats also to our four Open Rubbers teams who all very narrowly lost in the semi's with a bit of controversy thrown in for good measure. Well done Seamus, Parth, Tim, Igor, Freya, Will, Antony, Melrain, Jessica and Jaden. We are super proud of the maturity, great sporting attitudes and a lot of dignity displayed by all of our players. You are wonderful young people. The next season is going to be great for you all.  

## Winter 2022 

Some changes are afoot for us at HE Parker Reserve. We have made the decision to enter our Juniors in the Winter 22 season with WDTA.  

Our club is already affiliated with Waverley District Tennis Association and have had a number of weekend and weekday teams playing with them over the years. Geographically we are in an overlap space between the two associations with many teams in our local area also affiliated with WDTA. 

We've given consideration to a range of factors and feel this will be a great option for our club at this time. Here's a link to the association website: [waverleytennis.asn.au](https://waverleytennis.asn.au).

Some other advantages include: 

  * More match play for our singles/doubles rubbers players. (Doubles is also a two set rubber so 4 sets instead of 3 each round. 33% more tennis!!)  
  * A more manageable team size for other formats.  (eg Triples with capacity for more players but less pressure to fill a team if there are extenuating circumstances.)
  * The requirement for any all boys teams to play in all boys competition. 
  * Mixed competition is actually mixed competition, so our girls get a better gender diverse experience. Some of our girls have barely seen another girl on the court all season! 
  * Branching out to meet new people and visit new places. Something made all too difficult in the 2020-21 Covid era. 

The season begins on April 30/May 1. Match play commences at **8.15am on Saturdays** and **8.30am on Sundays**. Info will be sent out to teams as soon as it is available. Communication with WDTA has been great and it's looking to be a great experience ahead. 

Note re Orange Ball: We will have one Orange Ball team sticking with ERT on Sundays as Waverley runs a very short season for that level and we'd like them to get a full season of play.   

## Uniforms- Club T Shirts 

As we move into this new phase and our kids move on from two years of Covid interruptions to life, club identity and a sense of belonging is more important than ever. 
**We will be organising club gear for ALL juniors. Our focus is on every player wearing a club T Shirt asap**. 

Erina, our club secretary, has put a lot of work into organising terrific gear for us. Covid lockdowns put the brakes on rolling that out across the club but now is the time to embrace our unity together and look cool on the courts as proud HE Parker players! 

Committee is working out how to roll out uniforms in as timely and cost effective a manner as possible. We will keep you posted. Sizing info is [here](https://projectclothing.com.au/pages/size-chart-1). If players want to go the whole hog with shorts/skort as well, I'm told they are super comfy too! 

## Fees and Club Membership 

There will be a **ball money** fee of $25 for each player at the start of the season. 
You can pay this directly to 

> **A/C**:  HE Parker Reserve Tennis Club Inc<br>
> **BSB**: 633-000<br>
> **A/C number**: 1338 50826<br>
> **Reference**: Balls Jnr Child's Name 

Club membership is a must. Please help myself and Chris and take steps to ensure you are on top of that. I'd really encourage you to think of the benefits of a family membership too and then take advantage of organised social match play with other club members and making use of our facilities at times of your choosing with your own family and club friends. 

Our club kindly pays for team registration fees. 

Have a great term break.

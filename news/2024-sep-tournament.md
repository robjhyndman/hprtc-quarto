Dear All,

Hope you're well and enjoying your tennis.

When Spring arrives make sure you are ready for our HE Parker Tennis Club Community Series where family members can team up for some exciting doubles action. Full details attached.

If you have any queries, please contact coach Ben.

This will be a great precursor to our Club Championships on Cup weekend in November.

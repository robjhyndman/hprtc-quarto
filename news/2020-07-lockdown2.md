Dear members,

Please note that as of midnight tonight, the Maroondah Council has instructed the committee to close the clubhouse and place restrictions on the use of courts, as per the guidelines from Tennis Victoria.

Please note that the clubhouse, including the toilets will be off-limits.

The courts remain accessible to members - however, doubles only permitted by members of the same household, and singles for those not of the same household.  Coach Ben is able to continue providing 1:1 coaching sessions - please reach out and support Ben if you are able to do so during this period.

Our court booking system via coach Ben's Facebook page (AdvantEdge Tennis) remains in place and no booking, no play. https://www.facebook.com/advantedgetennis

Please continue to follow social distancing rules as communicated previously.  The club continues to provide hand sanitizer on each court.

We will keep you posted should any further changes arise.

Please stay safe and all the best with the six weeks of lockdown.

Kind regards,

Lenelle

(Club Secretary)

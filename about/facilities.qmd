## Maintenance

![image alt >](/media/tennis.png) Just like your own home, there are lots of small, and sometimes large, things that go wrong. You, as a member of the club, can help with the maintenance. Some of these things are: attending working bees, not leaving drink bottles and rubbish on the courts, pulling out weeds you find growing on the courts, picking up a handful of leaves from the courts when you see them (and of course putting them in the bin), hanging up the court brooms after you have used them, leaving the drag mats **flat on the ground** after use, reporting any issues that require attention on the notice board in the clubhouse, etc.

The courts do not normally require bagging between sets. However, they **DO** require bagging at the end of your play session. This is extremely important for the longevity of the courts.

If there are issues that require urgent attention, please contact our Maintenance Convenor - [maintenance@hprtc.org.au](mailto:maintenance@hprtc.org.au)

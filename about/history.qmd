HE Parker Reserve Tennis Club when the Heathmont Methodist Tennis Club was granted land alongside the Dandenong Creek at HE Parker Reserve by the Ringwood City Council to form a public tennis club.

Four courts and a log cabin clubhouse were built and the Clubhouse was officially opened in 1975 although conditions were still rather primitive. By 1984, 2 more courts were built and shortly after that 3 courts were floodlit for night tennis.

Membership remains the main source of income for the club.  It also forms the basis of our sense of community. Long term access to the club can only be gained through membership. The committee works very hard to ensure the fees for membership remain affordable and sustainable for the club.

Memberships are annual and apply from 1 July to 30 June.

### Who requires a membership?

  1. Any adult (18+) playing social tennis more than 5 times.
  2. Any adult receiving coaching at the club for more than 5 sessions.
  3. Any junior playing Saturday or Sunday competition.
  4. Any junior being coached for more than 1 school term.

Please note: These grace periods do not apply if the adult or junior has been a member previously.

        "![image alt <](/media/BenLongridge.jpg) One of the key strengths of a club is its coaches.  HE Parker prides itself on selecting great coaches who can instruct, encourage and improve our junior competition teams but also provide assistance on tennis technique for all of our members, regardless of age, gender, physical ability, fitness or experience.  We are delighted to have the services of [**Ben Longridge**](https://www.advantedgetennisacademy.com.au) as our head coach.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ben and his coaching team have a primary focus of improving members tennis skill in a positive, fun manner. Group coaching is designed to give all students, in particularly children a solid grounding in all relevant areas of the game should they want to develop their tennis further with private lessons and extra match play (tournaments, representative competition etc.). We pride ourselves on everyone leaving each lesson with key areas and themes to work on, making the path to improvement easier to understand.\n",

        "\n",
        "  1. Embrace the tasks you are given\n",
        "  2. Make the coach aware of any injury you or your child may be carrying prior to the lesson start\n",
        "  3. Arrive at least 5 mins before the session to ensure you are ready to start and maximise your time on court\n",
        "  4. The coaching team encourages self-practice in your own time. Before your next lesson, take some time to work on themes that have been introduced in previous lessons.\n",
        "  5. If in doubt about weather, please call or text Ben for advice as to what is happening.\n",
        "  6. The coaching staff are knowledgeable. Feel free to ask questions!\n",
